# ✅ QUICK CHECKOUT TEST GUIDE

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

The checkout button error **"Erro ao processar pedido. Por favor, tente novamente."** was caused by:
- Hidden form fields marked as required
- Browser validation error: "An invalid form control is not focusable"
- Form submission blocked

**FIX**: Dynamic validation that only requires visible fields
