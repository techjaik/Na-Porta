## 🔍 ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE

### Security Issues
1. Database credentials in code (simple_address_api.php, simple_checkout.php)
2. Missing CSRF tokens in some forms
3. Potential XSS in user-generated content
4. File upload validation gaps
5. Missing rate limiting on APIs

### Functionality Issues
1. Address API errors (reported by user)
2. Checkout button not working (FIXED - needs verification)
3. Performance issues (FIXED - needs verification)
4. Cart not persisting for anonymous users
5. Search functionality (may not exist)

### Code Quality Issues
1. Multiple debug/test files in production
2. Duplicate code in simple_*.php files
3. Inconsistent error handling
4. Missing input validation in some places
5. Hardcoded database credentials

---

## 🛠️ FIXES TO IMPLEMENT

### Priority 1 (Critical)
- [ ] Remove database credentials from code
- [ ] Add CSRF tokens to all forms
- [ ] Implement input validation everywhere
- [ ] Fix checkout button (verify fix works)
- [ ] Secure file uploads

### Priority 2 (High)
- [ ] Add rate limiting to APIs
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Add logging for security events
- [ ] Implement proper session handling
- [ ] Add XSS protection

### Priority 3 (Medium)
- [ ] Clean up debug files
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate code
- [ ] Add missing features (search)
- [ ] Improve performance further
- [ ] Add caching
